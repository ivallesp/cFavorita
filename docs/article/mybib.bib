	abstract = {This paper introduces LMFAO (Layered Multiple Functional Aggregate Optimization), an in-memory optimization and execution engine for batches of aggregates over the input database. The primary motivation for this work stems from the observation that for a variety of analytics over databases, their data-intensive tasks can be decomposed into group-by aggregates over the join of the input database relations. We exemplify the versatility and competitiveness of LMFAO for a handful of widely used analytics: learning ridge linear regression, classification trees, regression trees, and the structure of Bayesian networks using Chow-Liu trees; and data cubes used for exploration in data warehousing. LMFAO consists of several layers of logical and code optimizations that systematically exploit sharing of computation, parallelism, and code specialization. We conducted two types of performance benchmarks. In experiments with four datasets, LMFAO outperforms by several orders of magnitude on one hand, a commercial database system and MonetDB for computing batches of aggregates, and on the other hand, TensorFlow, Scikit, R, and AC/DC for learning a variety of models over databases.},

 	abstract = {Integrated solutions for analytics over relational databases are of great practical importance as they avoid the costly repeated loop data scientists have to deal with on a daily basis: select features from data residing in relational databases using feature extraction queries involving joins, projections, and aggregations; export the training dataset defined by such queries; convert this dataset into the format of an external learning tool; and train the desired model using this tool. These integrated solutions are also a fertile ground of theoretically fundamental and challenging problems at the intersection of relational and statistical data models.This article introduces a unified framework for training and evaluating a class of statistical learning models over relational databases. This class includes ridge linear regression, polynomial regression, factorization machines, and principal component analysis. We show that, by synergizing key tools from database theory such as schema information, query structure, functional dependencies, recent advances in query evaluation algorithms, and from linear algebra such as tensor and matrix operations, one can formulate relational analytics problems and design efficient (query and data) structure-aware algorithms to solve them.This theoretical development informed the design and implementation of the AC/DC system for structure-aware learning. We benchmark the performance of AC/DC against R, MADlib, libFM, and TensorFlow. For typical retail forecasting and advertisement planning applications, AC/DC can learn polynomial regression models and factorization machines with at least the same accuracy as its competitors and up to three orders of magnitude faster than its competitors whenever they do not run out of memory, exceed 24-hour timeout, or encounter internal design limitations.},
