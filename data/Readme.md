# Data source
The data contained in this folder has been downloaded from Kaggle, from the *Corporaci√≥n Favorita* competition. The 
[Kaggle official API](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api) has been used to download the data, although it can be 
directly downloaded from the competition website and manually placed into this folder.

If you want to use the official API follow the instructions to configure it, providing it with the API key, and then 
navigate to the `data` folder through your terminal and run the following command: 
`kaggle competitions download favorita-grocery-sales-forecasting`. 

Once downloaded, uncompress the files using your 
favorite compressor; bear in mind that they come in *7zip* format.
